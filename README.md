  █ SHN-01 IS A MINIMALIST, TERMINAL-DRIVEN CONTROL SYSTEM FOR  
    MINECRAFT'S OPENCOMPUTERS, BUILT TO SERVE AS A CENTRAL COMMAND  
    HUB FOR A NETWORK OF DISTRIBUTED NODES EQUIPPED WITH LINKED EEPROMs.

  █ IT PROVIDES REMOTE FLASHING CAPABILITIES AND REAL-TIME CODE  
    EXECUTION ON EXTERNAL COMPUTERS, TRANSFORMING THEM INTO  
    PROGRAMMABLE, ADAPTABLE AGENTS WITHIN A UNIFIED AUTOMATION ECOSYSTEM.

  █ DESIGNED FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE AND MODULARITY WITHIN A SANDBOXED LUA  
    ENVIRONMENT, IT FOCUSES ON KEYBOARD-FIRST INTERACTION THROUGH A  
    RETRO-STYLE CONSOLE INTERFACE.

  █ SHN-01 ENABLES SEAMLESS ORCHESTRATION AND MANAGEMENT OF  
    COMPLEX FACTORY AUTOMATION SETUPS AND AUTONOMOUS DRONE SWARMS,  
    PROVIDING A SINGLE CONTROL LAYER FOR INTELLIGENT DEVICE SWARMS  
    WITH LIVE UPDATES AND TELEMETRY.

  █ REQUIRING ONLY MINIMAL RESOURCES, SHN-01 RUNS ENTIRELY ON TIER 1  
    HARDWARE, MAKING IT ACCESSIBLE, LIGHTWEIGHT, AND IDEAL FOR  
    DEPLOYMENT IN CONSTRAINED OR EARLY-GAME ENVIRONMENTS.
